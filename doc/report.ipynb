    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses provide numerous services to their clients. It becomes important for them to know whether their clients need those services. Banking is one sector which provides numerous services to their clients. If a client subscribes to their service, it increases revenue for the bank. One such service offered by banks is *Term Deposit*. A term deposit is a form of deposit in which money is held for a fixed duration of time with the financial institution. A client will subscribe to a term deposit or not is dependent on a large number of features of a client. Banks generally have this information of clients which can help to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. This is an interesting problem which can be solved by analysing the data and building model to predict such clients behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will analyze a *Bank Marketing* data of a Portuguese banking institution, and predict whether the a client will subscribe for a term deposit from the marketing campaign. \n"

    "The dataset has 4521 observations, 16 features and a response variable `y` which indicates if the client subscribed a term deposit or not (binary: 'yes','no'). The classes are imbalance: there are 4000 no and 521 yes. There are 0 observations with missing values in the data set. "
