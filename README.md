# Bank Marketing Project

In this project we are analyzing a Portuguese banking institution data. Using this data we will try to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. Further project details can be found in the [Project Proposal](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DMC_Portuguese_Group_402/blob/master/project_proposal.md)

The dataset we chose is Bank Marketing data of a Portuguese banking institution collected from UCI Machine learning Repository. The dataset was donated in 2012-02-14. It was sourced from S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita in a research paper "A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing". Detail of the source is provided in the reference session.

The dataset has 4521 observations, 16 features and a response variable y which indicates if the client subscribed a term deposit or not (binary: 'yes','no'). The classes are imbalance: there are 4000 no and 521 yes. There are 0 observations with missing values in the data set.
